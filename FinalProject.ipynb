Since both Toronto and New York are financial centers we can expect tourism being a big part of bringing new business into a city. Each city will have a different appeal of what attracts people to a given location versus another."

        "For tourism and thus local business to be successful then there must be ample appeal to an area. Since human beings are natural social creatures who seek out interaction with one another then we should see a high number of meeting areas to be present. I would expect cities to have a fair amount of recreation areas in nature for people to explore. For a city to sustain their population there must be adequate natural resources locally or they must be brought in. As you can see there are several dependencies for a city to be successful."
